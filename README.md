# Flask-Weather-App
**This is a Flask-based weather application that makes use of the Open Weather API and is deployed using Vagrant, Docker, Docker-Swarm and Ansible.**

Vagrant is used to create the Virtual Machines(VM), Docker is used for containerization, and Docker-Swarm is used for orchestration. Ansible is being used to automate all of the processes rather than manually installing them on the VM.

Certain things must be installed on your system before you can work on this project.
